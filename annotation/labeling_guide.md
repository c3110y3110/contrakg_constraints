# Manual labeling guide (ContraKG-Constraints)

Goal: validate that each contrast pair is a *minimal edit* targeting a *specific constraint type* and remains *natural enough*.

## What to label (4 checkboxes)
1) Fluency: contrast sentence is grammatical / understandable (yes/no)
2) Minimal edit: localized entity swap / simple 'and X' insertion (yes/no)
3) Target hit: intended constraint type is correct (yes/no/unsure)
4) Template preserved: relation meaning/template not changed (yes/no)

Notes:
- Do NOT judge factual truth. Only judge whether the contrast is usable as a behavioral test for constraints.
- If unsure due to Wikidata exceptions, mark 'unsure' and add a note.
